## 📝 Project Summary (As per Program Guidelines)  

This project was developed following the core objectives of the **Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights** program on Forage.  

I performed comprehensive data cleaning, handling missing values, removing invalid rows, and ensuring data quality before visualization.  
The Power BI dashboard contains multiple pages with advanced interactivity features like page navigation buttons and slicers for easy analysis.  

Key Highlights:
- On **Page 1**, I provided a global sales overview (including the UK).  
- On **Page 2**, I showcased a global sales overview **excluding the UK**, as per the program's recommendation.  
- I also checked for **null values**, removed duplicates, handled **invalid rows** such as:
  - **Invalid Rows (Quantity < 1): 10,624**  
  - **Invalid Rows (UnitPrice < 0): 2**  
- The cleaned dataset was used for creating actionable business insights through Power BI visualizations.

## 📸 Power BI Dashboard Snapshots  

I also implemented **Page Navigation Buttons** within the dashboard to allow smooth navigation between different report pages.  
This improves the interactivity and user experience by helping users switch between insights easily.
